I'm looking for my own way
Living in the confusion of reality
I just can't give up my dream
Even if there's no guarantee

The future that's already in motion
I want to grab onto it tightly
Even if I'm lost in the darkness
I won't let go of my hope

Generation, our hands reach out
We're not alone, we can fly higher
Believe, believe in yourself
The light shines within you

I'll keep moving forward
With courage and strength
I'll spread my wings
And take off towards the sky

Generation, let's raise our voices
We'll break down the walls that hold us back
Believe, believe in the power of unity
Together, we'll change the world

We'll never give up
Our hearts beat as one
We'll overcome any obstacle
With our love and passion

Generation, our hands reach out
We're not alone, we can fly higher
Believe, believe in yourself
The light shines within you

Generation, let's raise our voices
We'll break down the walls that hold us back
Believe, believe in the power of unity
Together, we'll change the world
